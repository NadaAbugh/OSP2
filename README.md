EE463 - OSP2
------------

Authors: Nada Abughazalah and Dareen Bukhari

As the project requirement for the Operating Systems (EE463) course 

Two modules were coded:

* **Virtual memory management:** Implemented the enhanced second chance algorithm as the global page replacement strategy

* **Threads:** Implemented CPU scheduling using the FCFS algorithm 

The written code is tested on paramter files whose results are compared with the OSP2 demo that uses round-robin for CPU scheduling and pre-paging for page replacement.
